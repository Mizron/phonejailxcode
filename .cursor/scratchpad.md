## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've successfully implemented the LLM service with the following features:
1. Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 API
2. Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
3. Support for different AI personalities
4. Context-aware response generation
5. Unit tests with mocked network responses

The service is designed to be:
- Thread-safe with @MainActor
- Observable for UI updates
- Configurable for different API endpoints
- Testable with dependency injection

Next steps:
1. Create basic UI components for the app
2. Implement app discovery functionality
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Would you like me to proceed with creating the basic UI components?
